<p><strong>I write whenever people want to read. I like sharing insights and explaining the complicated.</strong></p>
<h3>Blogging</h3>
<p>I'm planning to get back to blogging in 2021. TODO: add the link here.</p>
<p>Other than that, I started and cancelled numerous blogging projects between 2004 and 2015. One of my old blogs is <a href="https://archiwum.lukem.net/"><strong>still available online</strong></a>.</p>
<h3>Books</h3>
<p>I wrote three books, mostly about WordPress. About five thousand copies sold. I may write more someday, who knows.</p>
