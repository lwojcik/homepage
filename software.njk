<p><strong>I build websites and web applications since 2010. It's been an amazing journey and I have no plans of stopping any time soon.</strong></p>
<p>But it all started much earlier. In 2001 I published my first webpage despite having no Internet access at home. In 2006 I was learning PHP and coding WordPress themes.</p>
<p>Nowadays, my primary interest is <strong>JavaScript development</strong> with particular focus on building modern web applications using <strong>React</strong>, <strong>TypeScript</strong> and <strong>Node.js</strong>.</p>
<p>I like trying different hats whenever I can. I sometimes build full-stack applications with Fastify and MongoDB, configure Linux servers, write Ansible roles, set up automated workflows with existing tools and so on.</p>
