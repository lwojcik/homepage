<p><strong>I build websites and web applications since 2010. It's been an amazing journey and I have no plans of stopping any time soon.</strong></p>
<p>But it all started much earlier. In 2001 I published <a href="https://github.com/lwojcik/meloomoto">my first website</a> despite no Internet access at home. In 2006 I was tinkering with PHP and <a href="https://github.com/lwojcik/blogimalistic">coding WordPress themes</a>.</p>
<p>Nowadays, my primary interest is <strong>JavaScript development</strong> with particular focus on building modern web applications using <strong>React</strong>, <strong>TypeScript</strong> and <strong>Node.js</strong>.</p>
<p>I like trying different hats whenever I can. I sometimes build <a href="https://github.com/sc2pte/panel-backend">server-side apps with Fastify and MongoDB</a>, configure Linux servers, write <a href="https://github.com/lwojcik?tab=repositories&q=ansible">Ansible roles</a>, set up automated workflows with existing tools and many others.</p>
