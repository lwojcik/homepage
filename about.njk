<p><strong>My name is Łukasz Wójcik</strong>, also known as <strong>Lukem</strong>. People sometimes call me Luke and this is fine as long as they know I'm not a son of Darth Vader.</p>
<p>I live in Warsaw, Poland. I'm a web developer, which in simpler terms means I build things that run in web browsers using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I occasionally dabble in Linux servers, Adobe Photoshop and video editing.</p>
<p>As a lifelong computer nerd I like figuring out how things work and cracking interesting problems with technology and software.</p>
<p>I like video games, photography, electronic music, shooting sports, cats and whisky. Not necessarily in that order and definitely not all of them at the same time.</p>
